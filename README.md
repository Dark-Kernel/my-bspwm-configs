# my-bspwm-configs

**I have included bspwmswallow from `https://github.com/JopStro/bspswallow`so all credits of swallow goes to him

**polybars-theme i got from `https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes.git` which is too cool. I have just used shades theme and have made some important configuration to git it minimal look. On thing i have used pywal also
